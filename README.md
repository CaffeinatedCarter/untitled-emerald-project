# Untitled (Epsilon?) Emerald Project

## Wish List
### Big changes
### Additions
### Tweaks
* Removing unnecessary dialogue (press A to HM, picking up items, Nurse Joy dialogue can happen over cutscene, etc.)
* Gyms should be a gauntlet. Set style only, can't exit without restarting trainers. Move Jim outside blocking the door to confirm the gauntlet.
* HM items? Field moves?
* There should be a way to rapid level up Pokémon. 6 levels per gym badge unlocked. Beating Brawly unlocks this. Up to 60 after beating Elite 4 once. Up to 100 after beating a second time.
  *  Is this something that happens on the PC?
* Lower the encounter rate on water overall
* Fix Feebas spawning (mirror ORAS!)
* Every time you pick up an item, you get the Pokéball as an item. Different balls for different rarity of items (Nugget → Great Ball, etc)
* Cut trees and rocks smashed should not respawn on exiting area. Maybe should be on a timer? Only in the overworld and not in caves?
* Nuzlocke/Randomizer/Challenge mode.
* Fly point to the Berry Master's house? Potentially flying to routes in general?
* Change the money system a little. Implement Mystery Dungeon-esque banking and blacking out wipes your cash reserves. Have shops call from your "credit" so it doesn't affect much.
* Normalize losing to trainers.
* Challenging routes? Maybe implementing First → Second → Third choice to limit the number of Pokémon you bring?
* Literally can we have a conclusion to the Winstrates.
* Combine Mach and Acro bikes after a certain point. Maybe halfway?
* B/W-style EXP curve

## Area Ideas
### Expansions
* Shoal Cave
* Underwater Routes
* The route to Mt. Pyre
* Fiery Path
* Elite Four → Separate Rooms, choose your own order
* Ever Grande City → maybe merge with battle tower? Move Battle Tower to Ever Grande and have the Pokémon league be at the center? Have your mom and prominent characters there cheering you on?
* Slateport Market → Add rotating berry dealer, rotating pokeball dealer, etc. Maybe pay for a random berry
* Make Lilycove's pokemart more useful

### Water Routes
* Swampy or Marshy
* Tropical
* Polluted

### Little Things
* Ledge to Fallarbor 
* Cut trees in front of the Cutter's house in Rustboro
* Rock smashed in Rusturf tunnel should be distinct. Maybe need a high-level Pokémon to use strength? Maybe make the rock visually different? This one is weird and vague.


## Gyms
* Tate and Liza – should be a doubles gym, not just Psychic
* Norman's gym should use stat-boosting moves as well. Don't forget stat change eliminations. Higher Pokémon diversity with like, actual strategy involved
* Ice gym should be weather-themed. Potentially see Castform get some use?

## Patches
* 720 Pokémon
* Physical/Special split
* Unlimited TMs

### Never gonna happens (but would LOVE)
* Rotation battles
* Doubles movesets
* Trainer customization
  * This could literally just be "select ur favorite color" at the beginning to pick outfit color
