# Untitled (Clarified?) Emerald Project

## Wish List
### Big changes
* Removing unnecessary dialogue (press A to HM, picking up items, Nurse Joy dialogue can happen over cutscene, etc.)
* Gyms should be a gauntlet. Set style only, can't exit without restarting trainers. Move Jim outside blocking the door to confirm the gauntlet.
* HM items? Field moves?
* There should be a way to rapid level up Pokémon. 6 levels per gym badge unlocked. Beating Brawly unlocks this. Up to 60 after beating Elite 4 once. Up to 100 after beating a second time.
  *  Is this something that happens on the PC?
* Cut trees and rocks smashed should not respawn on exiting area. Maybe should be on a timer? Only in the overworld and not in caves?
* Nuzlocke/Randomizer/Challenge mode.
* Wild Pokémon levels should be curved to gym progress in open areas 
  * Slateport-Mauville-Verdanturf
  * Lilycove-Mossdeep-Ever Grande-Pacifidlog-Sootopolis
* Add fairy type. I think May/Brendan could be a killer champion with a fairy type team
* Fly from town map. Make flying faster over all. Maybe disable flying in routes if you haven’t visited the next city? To prevent too much pokecenter use
* Trainers should rebattle you no matter what after a short time
* I’d love to see more field move effects. Sweet Scent should guarantee 1 perfect IV or like opposite gender has a higher likelihood of appearing. Uproar should attract wild Pokémon too except in rusturf tunnel. 

### Additions
* Every time you pick up an item, you get the Pokéball as an item. Different balls for different rarity of items (Nugget → Great Ball, etc)


### Tweaks
* Prompt to repel
* Item sorting
* Auto-run option in menu
* Remove berry tree death
* Combine Mach and Acro bikes after a certain point. Maybe halfway?
* Fly point tothe Berry Master's house? Potentially flying to routes in general?
* Change the money system a little
* Normalize losing to trainers ?? 
* Challenging routes? Maybe implementing First → Second → Third choice to limit the number of Pokémon you bring?
* Literally can we have a conclusion to the Winstrates.
* B/W-style EXP curve
- Muddy water should have super effective damage to Water types and normal damage to grass
- Add more overworld Pokémon. Pidgey in cities etc
- Make mauville more distinct
- Nix trade evolutions 
- Magnemite and Dugtrio should only evolve when you level up one with three in ur party
- Mom deserves a bedroom and should call you once in awhile
- I’d love more than one dialogue line when interacting with mom
- Running in fortree/pacifidlog
- ORAS breeding and more transparency in breeding overall. Explain mechanics etc
- Mirage island should appear with a premonition Pokémon in ur party like Xatu. Should have a legendary if going in post-game
- Make gender make sense. No female Mr Mime or male jynx. Gardevoir and Gallade split etc
- Rebalance super effective moves and evaluate STAB bonus
- Pokeballs themed after trainer classes
- More melanin in character models
- Berries need to be more prevalent and easier to deal with
- More bag storage
- Rebalancing friendship so you’re not “instantly” friends w Pokémon. Potentially affection?
- Bag sorting
- Remove critical hits entirely
- Nuzlocke settings with how your game ends
- Evasiveness?? Either make it more prominent or less prominent
- Restructure Steven into the main story
- shorten beeping sound for low health
- Little phrases from prominent trainers when the battle is almost over
- Poison types can't be poisoned
- (done) Allow running indoors
- (done) Default text speed to Fast
- (done) Make TMs infinite/unsellable/ungiveable

## Area Ideas
### Expansions
* Shoal Cave
* Underwater Routes
* The route to Mt. Pyre
* Fiery Path
* Elite Four → Separate Rooms, choose your own order
* Ever Grande City → maybe merge with battle tower? Move Battle Tower to Ever Grande and have the Pokémon league be at the center? Have your mom and prominent characters there cheering you on?
* Slateport Market → Add rotating berry dealer, rotating pokeball dealer, etc. Maybe pay for a random berry
* Make Lilycove's pokemart more useful

### Water Routes
* Swampy or Marshy
* Tropical
* Polluted

### Little Things
* Ledge to Fallarbor 
* Cut trees in front of the Cutter's house in Rustboro
* Rock smashed in Rusturf tunnel should be distinct. Maybe need a high-level Pokémon to use strength? Maybe make the rock visually different? This one is weird and vague.
* Fishing off of Pacifidlog should give you a Corsola
* Lower the encounter rate on water overall
* Fix Feebas spawning (mirror ORAS!)


## Gyms
* Tate and Liza – should be a doubles gym, not just Psychic
* Norman's gym should use stat-boosting moves as well. Don't forget stat change eliminations. Higher Pokémon diversity with like, actual strategy involved
* Ice gym should be weather-themed. Potentially see Castform get some use?



### Never gonna happens (but would LOVE)
* Rotation battles
* Doubles movesets
* Trainer customization
  * This could literally just be "select ur favorite color" at the beginning to pick outfit color
