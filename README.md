## Wish List
* Removing unnecessary dialogue (press A to HM, picking up items, Nurse Joy dialogue can happen over cutscene, etc.)
* Gyms should be a gauntlet. Set style only, can't exit without restarting trainers. Move Jim outside blocking the door to confirm the gauntlet.
* HM items? Field moves?
