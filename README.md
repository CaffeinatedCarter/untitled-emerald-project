# Untitled (Clarified?) Emerald Project

The objective of this decompiled Pokémon Emerald ROM hack is to ground more of the Pokémon mechanics in reality and create a more robust experience by tweaking small things to make the game more fun to play.

You can see how I hope to accomplish that in the [Projects Tab](https://github.com/descripteur/untitled-emerald-project/projects/)!
