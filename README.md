# Untitled (Epsilon?) Emerald Project

## Wish List
* Removing unnecessary dialogue (press A to HM, picking up items, Nurse Joy dialogue can happen over cutscene, etc.)
* Gyms should be a gauntlet. Set style only, can't exit without restarting trainers. Move Jim outside blocking the door to confirm the gauntlet.
* HM items? Field moves?
* There should be a way to rapid level up Pokémon. 6 levels per gym badge unlocked. Beating Brawly unlocks this. Up to 60 after beating Elite 4 once. Up to 100 after beating a second time.
  *  Is this something that happens on the PC?
* Lower the encounter rate on water overall
* Fix Feebas spawning (mirror ORAS!)
